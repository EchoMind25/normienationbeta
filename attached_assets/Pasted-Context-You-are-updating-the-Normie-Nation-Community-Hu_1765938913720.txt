Context
You are updating the Normie Nation Community Hub (https://normienation.replit.app/) for the $NORMIE memecoin (Solana token: FrSFwE2BxWADEyUWFXDMAeomzuB4r83ZvzdG9sevpump). This is Phase 1 of a multi-phase rebuild converting the app into a comprehensive community center.
Objectives for This Phase
1. Remove Shop Feature

Delete all shop-related components, routes, and UI elements
Remove mock payment flows (Solana Pay, Stripe interfaces)
Clean up any shop-related dependencies
Preserve: Dashboard, Meme Generator, Polls, Community Links

2. Integrate Live Solana Data
Replace ALL mock data with live blockchain queries using:

RPC Endpoint: https://solana-rpc.publicnode.com
Token Address: FrSFwE2BxWADEyUWFXDMAeomzuB4r83ZvzdG9sevpump
Library: @solana/web3.js (install if not present)

3. Required Live Metrics
Display these on the dashboard with 5-10 second WebSocket updates:

Current Price (USD)
Market Cap (USD)
24h Volume (USD)
Total Supply
Circulating Supply
Burned Tokens (precise count, currently ~572M)
Locked Tokens (currently ~230M)
Holder Count
Liquidity Pool (SOL and USD values)

4. Chart Enhancements

Maintain existing Chart.js line graphs for price/volume
CRITICAL: Add visual indicators (dots/markers) on the chart showing Dev buy transactions
Query transaction history to identify and plot these buys with timestamps

Technical Requirements
Backend Integration:
javascript// Use Solana Web3.js to query:
// - Token account info for supply/burns
// - getParsedAccountInfo for holder counts
// - getSignaturesForAddress for transaction history (Dev buys)
// - Integrate with pump.fun API if available for price/market cap
WebSocket Setup:

Implement Socket.io or native WebSockets for real-time updates
Poll Solana RPC every 5-10 seconds
Cache responses to avoid rate limiting

Error Handling:

Fallback to cached data if RPC fails
Display connection status indicator
Log any RPC errors to console with timestamps

Security:

Store RPC endpoint in environment variables (Replit Secrets)
Validate all blockchain responses before rendering
Rate limit client-side requests

What to Keep

Dark mode UI with green/black 4chan aesthetic
Meme Generator (fabric.js canvas)
Community Polls
Telegram/X social links
Current responsive layout

Deliverables

Working dashboard with live Solana data
Removed shop code (no remnants)
Chart with Dev buy indicators
Console logs confirming data sources (for verification)

Required Agent Actions
After implementing, inform me of:

Any missing API endpoints or data sources you couldn't access
Specific Replit Secrets I need to configure (if any)
Dependencies you added/removed (with versions)
Any Solana RPC limitations encountered (rate limits, missing data)
Testing steps I should perform to verify accuracy
Estimated update frequency you achieved (actual vs. target 5-10s)
Any breaking changes to existing features

Constraints

Maintain current PostgreSQL setup (no changes this phase)
Do NOT add new features (streaming, auth, gallery) yet
Preserve existing file structure where possible
Ensure mobile responsiveness remains intact

Begin implementation and report progress with specific technical details. Flag blockers immediately.
